# Typing Bot 

Welcome to Typing Bot â€“ a tool to automate typing in typing test websites!

## Description

Typing Bot is a script designed to automate typing tasks on typing test websites, and beat other top typers of the world ðŸ¤—. It utilizes Puppeteer, a Node.js library, to control a headless Chrome browser and simulate typing behavior. With Typing Bot, you can quickly and effortlessly complete typing tests and improve your typing speed and accuracy.

## How It Works

1. **Launch Browser**: Typing Bot launches a headless Chrome browser using Puppeteer.

2. **Navigate to Website**: It navigates to the specified typing test website.

3. **Extract Text**: Typing Bot extracts text from the webpage, typically from a specific element containing the test content.

4. **Simulate Typing**: Using Puppeteer's keyboard emulation capabilities, Typing Bot simulates typing by pressing individual keys corresponding to the extracted text.

5. **Completion**: Once typing is complete, Typing Bot stops the browser session.
